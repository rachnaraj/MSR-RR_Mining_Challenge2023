Use this node version for new installations, but the previous NODE_VERSION variable for checking if the sufficient node version for execution is present.\n\nFor the bash script, modify the `nvm -> node` installation checks so that first it is determined whether the system has nvm first, if not it is installed via the script provided (which calls exit 0, so must be captured in a variable or in some other way have this exit not stop the entire script and instead continue execution.)\nOnly after this is the node installation, and version, checked, and modified as necessary via the `nvm` linux command line tool. \n\nFor the powershell script, please focus on implementing the colored and quality user experience mentioned at the beginning of this prompt, as well as adding the checking for and installation of if necessary scoop CLI package manager, which should then be used for subsequent installations where possible, such as nodejs. Additionally, check for and print the current nodejs version if it is installed, and if installed, determine if the installed version is greater than the necessary version to run the script. If so, print a message (with color) that explains this, then continue execution. If the system has a node version which is too old, print a warning message, then uninstall this old version, replacing it with a more recent version via scoop.

      "Prompt": "I have a set of python scripts that i use in all my projects, how can I import them into each project and maintain them? I use github",
      "Answer": "Creating a Python package can help you reuse your Python scripts across different projects. This package can be version-controlled on GitHub. When you make changes to the package, you can push those changes to GitHub and then pull the updates into your projects.Here's a high-level outline of what you would need to do:Structure your scripts into a Python package:You can create a Python package by structuring your scripts in a specific way. At a minimum, you would need to create an __init__.py file (which can be empty) in the same directory as your scripts. This tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.[CODE_BLOCK_0]If your package becomes more complex, you may want to further organize your scripts into sub-packages (which are simply sub-directories containing their own __init__.py files).Create a setup.py file:To make your package installable with pip, you would need to create a setup.py file in your package's root directory. This file contains metadata about your package like its name, version, description, and the packages it contains. Here's an example setup.py file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Push your package to GitHub:You can now initialize a Git repository in your package's root directory, commit your scripts, and push the repository to GitHub.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Install your package in your projects:You can install your package directly from GitHub using pip. You'll need to provide the URL to your GitHub repository and specify that pip should use Git to clone it.[CODE_BLOCK_3]After installing your package, you can import your scripts like you would with any other Python package. For example, if your package contains a script named script1.py with a function named function1, you could import and use it like this:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Maintain your package:When you want to make changes to your scripts, make the changes in your package and push them to GitHub. You can then update the package in your projects by reinstalling it with pip.[CODE_BLOCK_5]If your package is used in many projects and you frequently update it, you might want to consider publishing it on PyPI (the Python Package Index). This would make installing and updating your package as easy as running pip install your_package_name and pip install --upgrade your_package_name.Remember to keep the best practices in mind when you're working on your package. Write good documentation, follow a consistent style guide, write tests to ensure your code works as expected, and use semantic versioning to communicate what kind of changes each new version of your package includes.",

Additionally, check for and print the current nodejs version if it is installed, and if installed, determine if the installed version is greater than the necessary version to run the script. If so, print a message (with color) that explains this, then continue execution. If the system has a node version which is too old, print a warning message, then uninstall this old version, replacing it with a more recent version via scoop.

      "Prompt": "I have a set of python scripts that i use in all my projects, how can I import them into each project and maintain them? I use github",
      "Answer": "Creating a Python package can help you reuse your Python scripts across different projects. This package can be version-controlled on GitHub. When you make changes to the package, you can push those changes to GitHub and then pull the updates into your projects.Here's a high-level outline of what you would need to do:Structure your scripts into a Python package:You can create a Python package by structuring your scripts in a specific way. At a minimum, you would need to create an __init__.py file (which can be empty) in the same directory as your scripts. This tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.[CODE_BLOCK_0]If your package becomes more complex, you may want to further organize your scripts into sub-packages (which are simply sub-directories containing their own __init__.py files).Create a setup.py file:To make your package installable with pip, you would need to create a setup.py file in your package's root directory. This file contains metadata about your package like its name, version, description, and the packages it contains. Here's an example setup.py file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Push your package to GitHub:You can now initialize a Git repository in your package's root directory, commit your scripts, and push the repository to GitHub.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Install your package in your projects:You can install your package directly from GitHub using pip. You'll need to provide the URL to your GitHub repository and specify that pip should use Git to clone it.[CODE_BLOCK_3]After installing your package, you can import your scripts like you would with any other Python package. For example, if your package contains a script named script1.py with a function named function1, you could import and use it like this:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Maintain your package:When you want to make changes to your scripts, make the changes in your package and push them to GitHub. You can then update the package in your projects by reinstalling it with pip.[CODE_BLOCK_5]If your package is used in many projects and you frequently update it, you might want to consider publishing it on PyPI (the Python Package Index). This would make installing and updating your package as easy as running pip install your_package_name and pip install --upgrade your_package_name.Remember to keep the best practices in mind when you're working on your package. Write good documentation, follow a consistent style guide, write tests to ensure your code works as expected, and use semantic versioning to communicate what kind of changes each new version of your package includes.",

      "Prompt": "I have a set of python scripts that i use in all my projects, how can I import them into each project and maintain them? I use github",
      "Answer": "Creating a Python package can help you reuse your Python scripts across different projects. This package can be version-controlled on GitHub. When you make changes to the package, you can push those changes to GitHub and then pull the updates into your projects.Here's a high-level outline of what you would need to do:Structure your scripts into a Python package:You can create a Python package by structuring your scripts in a specific way. At a minimum, you would need to create an __init__.py file (which can be empty) in the same directory as your scripts. This tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.[CODE_BLOCK_0]If your package becomes more complex, you may want to further organize your scripts into sub-packages (which are simply sub-directories containing their own __init__.py files).Create a setup.py file:To make your package installable with pip, you would need to create a setup.py file in your package's root directory. This file contains metadata about your package like its name, version, description, and the packages it contains. Here's an example setup.py file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Push your package to GitHub:You can now initialize a Git repository in your package's root directory, commit your scripts, and push the repository to GitHub.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Install your package in your projects:You can install your package directly from GitHub using pip. You'll need to provide the URL to your GitHub repository and specify that pip should use Git to clone it.[CODE_BLOCK_3]After installing your package, you can import your scripts like you would with any other Python package. For example, if your package contains a script named script1.py with a function named function1, you could import and use it like this:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Maintain your package:When you want to make changes to your scripts, make the changes in your package and push them to GitHub. You can then update the package in your projects by reinstalling it with pip.[CODE_BLOCK_5]If your package is used in many projects and you frequently update it, you might want to consider publishing it on PyPI (the Python Package Index). This would make installing and updating your package as easy as running pip install your_package_name and pip install --upgrade your_package_name.Remember to keep the best practices in mind when you're working on your package. Write good documentation, follow a consistent style guide, write tests to ensure your code works as expected, and use semantic versioning to communicate what kind of changes each new version of your package includes.",

      "Prompt": "For both scripts,\n1. please add color & tact to the script mimicing the style of command line tools like pip3, with its unicode, colored, and speed displaying installation print flow. \n2. Please also do not simply install the exact version of nodejs that this script is written for, but instead add a new variable called INSTALL_NODE_VERSION, which holds \"16.18.0\". Use this node version for new installations, but the previous NODE_VERSION variable for checking if the sufficient node version for execution is present.\n\nFor the bash script, modify the `nvm -> node` installation checks so that first it is determined whether the system has nvm first, if not it is installed via the script provided (which calls exit 0, so must be captured in a variable or in some other way have this exit not stop the entire script and instead continue execution.)\nOnly after this is the node installation, and version, checked, and modified as necessary via the `nvm` linux command line tool. \n\nFor the powershell script, please focus on implementing the colored and quality user experience mentioned at the beginning of this prompt, as well as adding the checking for and installation of if necessary scoop CLI package manager, which should then be used for subsequent installations where possible, such as nodejs. Additionally, check for and print the current nodejs version if it is installed, and if installed, determine if the installed version is greater than the necessary version to run the script. If so, print a message (with color) that explains this, then continue execution. If the system has a node version which is too old, print a warning message, then uninstall this old version, replacing it with a more recent version via scoop. Follow the description in the beginning of this prompt to handle installation versions (meaning in this case, generally allow scoop to choose the node version, unless it is far too new (anything above node 18))",

      "Prompt": "I have a set of python scripts that i use in all my projects, how can I import them into each project and maintain them? I use github",
      "Answer": "Creating a Python package can help you reuse your Python scripts across different projects. This package can be version-controlled on GitHub. When you make changes to the package, you can push those changes to GitHub and then pull the updates into your projects.Here's a high-level outline of what you would need to do:Structure your scripts into a Python package:You can create a Python package by structuring your scripts in a specific way. At a minimum, you would need to create an __init__.py file (which can be empty) in the same directory as your scripts. This tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.[CODE_BLOCK_0]If your package becomes more complex, you may want to further organize your scripts into sub-packages (which are simply sub-directories containing their own __init__.py files).Create a setup.py file:To make your package installable with pip, you would need to create a setup.py file in your package's root directory. This file contains metadata about your package like its name, version, description, and the packages it contains. Here's an example setup.py file:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Push your package to GitHub:You can now initialize a Git repository in your package's root directory, commit your scripts, and push the repository to GitHub.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Install your package in your projects:You can install your package directly from GitHub using pip. You'll need to provide the URL to your GitHub repository and specify that pip should use Git to clone it.[CODE_BLOCK_3]After installing your package, you can import your scripts like you would with any other Python package. For example, if your package contains a script named script1.py with a function named function1, you could import and use it like this:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Maintain your package:When you want to make changes to your scripts, make the changes in your package and push them to GitHub. You can then update the package in your projects by reinstalling it with pip.[CODE_BLOCK_5]If your package is used in many projects and you frequently update it, you might want to consider publishing it on PyPI (the Python Package Index). This would make installing and updating your package as easy as running pip install your_package_name and pip install --upgrade your_package_name.Remember to keep the best practices in mind when you're working on your package. Write good documentation, follow a consistent style guide, write tests to ensure your code works as expected, and use semantic versioning to communicate what kind of changes each new version of your package includes.",

Additionally, check for and print the current nodejs version if it is installed, and if installed, determine if the installed version is greater than the necessary version to run the script. If so, print a message (with color) that explains this, then continue execution. If the system has a node version which is too old, print a warning message, then uninstall this old version, replacing it with a more recent version via scoop.

Use this node version for new installations, but the previous NODE_VERSION variable for checking if the sufficient node version for execution is present.\n\nFor the bash script, modify the `nvm -> node` installation checks so that first it is determined whether the system has nvm first, if not it is installed via the script provided (which calls exit 0, so must be captured in a variable or in some other way have this exit not stop the entire script and instead continue execution.)\nOnly after this is the node installation, and version, checked, and modified as necessary via the `nvm` linux command line tool. \n\nFor the powershell script, please focus on implementing the colored and quality user experience mentioned at the beginning of this prompt, as well as adding the checking for and installation of if necessary scoop CLI package manager, which should then be used for subsequent installations where possible, such as nodejs. Additionally, check for and print the current nodejs version if it is installed, and if installed, determine if the installed version is greater than the necessary version to run the script. If so, print a message (with color) that explains this, then continue execution. If the system has a node version which is too old, print a warning message, then uninstall this old version, replacing it with a more recent version via scoop.
